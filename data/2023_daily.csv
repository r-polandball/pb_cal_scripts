2023-01-03,Decision to start the January Uprising (1863),jPaolo,https://i.imgur.com/mvNABH5.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_Uprising,"3rd of January Central National Committe, the underground coordinating committee of the Polish independence movement in 1860s Congress Poland, decided to start an uprising against tsarist Russia. The uprising itself started 22nd of January but that date was taken by Lunar New Year.

Although the Uprising fell and didn't achieve anything substantial it was an enormous moment for Polish nation-building, art and literature.

The drawing shows the night when the fateful decision was made, faced with the order of forced conscription into Russian army, the Polish combatants decided that this was the last chance for independence. The viewer can see two Poland clays, one is sewing a flag of the January Uprising — white-crimson-blue horizontal tricolour with tri-partie coat of arms featuring Polish white eagle, Lithuanian Vytis, and Ruthenian Archangel Micheal — the other is ripping apart paper with tsar's order.

On a wall we see szlachta's saber, symbol of Polish military and defaced portrait of tsarist Russia (black-yellow-white) with captions ""LIAR"", ""THIEF"", ""BANDIT"", ""TYRANT"" in Polish.

The artwork was made with substantial help by users Canadapple (lighting and shadows) and Paulionm (shape of the flag's cloth)."

Over the course of the next seven months, copies of the treaty were toured around the country to give other chiefs the opportunity to sign. By the end of September, around 540 Maori chiefs had signed the Maori version of the Treaty.

The signing had the effect of securing British sovereignty over the islands of New Zealand, which was officially proclaimed on 21 May 1840.

Behind them are the Jews that have been saved from genocide.

The king and Haman are represented by the flag of the Achaemenid Empire, AKA the first Persian Empire. The king is wearing a crown based off of some drawings of Cyrus the Great. He is holding the scepter because the scepter is an important part of the story of Esther (he holds the scepter out to Esther to indicate he will not kill her). Haman is wearing a gold star to indicate that he is an important official (specifically, the viceroy to the king).

Mordecai and Esther are played by Israel because they are Jews (along with all the characters in the background). Mordecai is wearing a ribbon because he had previously saved the king's life and is in the king's favor."

This tragedy remains one of the thorns in the Polish-Ukrainian relations despite them immensely improving since the Russian invasion on the former.
The artwork is divided in two parts.

On the lower Poland solemnly submits a grave candle to a grave with a catholic cross, while Ukraine waits with its own grave candle while looking apologetically at Poland. On the upper part we can see a flashback of the Bloody Sunday drawn with only shades of red, where blood-coated Ukraine skewers Poland with a pitchfork and screams ""Death to Poles"" in Ukrainian.

Prussia and Russian Empire made plans to further divide Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 23rd of January. Grodno Sejm that ratified the cessions was held between 17th of June and 23rd of November. Cession to Russia was made official in 22 July and the prussian cession in 23rd of September or 25th of September depending on sources.

The artwork shows dismembered PLC laying on Castle Square sidewalk in the puddle of blood and scraps of the Constitution of 3rd of May.  Prussia and Russia walk away, each holding a bloody piece leaving red smears. USA is observing the situation making notes in a book titled ""Federalist Papers"". Turkey, United Kingdom, Austria, France, and Spain look the other way uninterested. Behind the Commonwealth a broken podium lays. It's raining and the dim grey lighting sets a grim mood."

The capital Vienna was also divided in four, with the historic central district being jointly administered by the “Allied Control Council”. Although the Austrian parliament was democratically elected, every legislative regulation or political action of the government at first required consent by the Allied Control Council and later on could still be vetoed by it.

The negotiations over a State Treaty putting an end to the occupation could finally be concluded in the spring of 1955: the Austrian State Treaty was signed on May 15, 1955, in Vienna's Schloss Belvedere and entered into force on July 27, 1955.

On October 26, 1955, the Austrian Parliament passed the constitutional law on permanent neutrality, which has been celebrated as the Austrian National day since 1965."
